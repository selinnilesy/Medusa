Here is information about Membrane Manufacturing Processes using PEEK.

1. Phase inversion: This process involves creating a polymer solution by dissolving PEEK in a solvent, and then casting the solution onto a substrate. The solvent is allowed to evaporate, leaving behind a thin layer of PEEK membrane. The membrane can be further treated by stretching, thermal bonding, or chemical modification to enhance its properties. 

2. Thermally induced phase separation (TIPS): TIPS is a process that involves exposing a PEEK solution to a temperature that causes the polymer to phase separate and form a membrane. The solution is cast onto a substrate, and then the temperature is rapidly increased to induce phase separation. The resulting membrane can be further treated by washing, stretching, or thermal bonding. 

3. Electrospinning: Electrospinning is a process that involves using an electric field to draw out PEEK fibers from a solution and deposit them onto a substrate. The fibers can be aligned in a specific direction to create a membrane with desired properties. The membrane can be further treated by heat treatment, chemical modification, or adding additional layers. 

4. Solvent casting: Solvent casting is a process that involves dissolving PEEK in a solvent and then casting the solution onto a substrate. The solvent is allowed to evaporate, leaving behind a thin layer of PEEK membrane. The membrane can be further treated by stretching, thermal bonding, or chemical modification to enhance its properties. 

5. Melt extrusion: Melt extrusion is a process that involves melting PEEK pellets and then extruding them through a die to create a membrane. The membrane can be further treated by stretching, thermal bonding, or chemical modification to enhance its properties. 

6. Thermal bonding: Thermal bonding is a process that involves bonding two PEEK layers together by applying heat and pressure. The layers can be bonded together by their own molecular forces or with the help of an adhesive. This process can be used to create composite membranes with specific properties. 7. Chemical modification: Chemical modification is a process that involves modifying the chemical structure of PEEK to enhance its properties. This can be done by adding functional groups, cross-linking, or grafting polymers. The modified PEEK membrane can have improved properties such as increased chemical resistance, better biocompatibility, or enhanced mechanical strength.

Here is information about PEEK avg Molecular Weight.

The average molecular weight of PEEK (PolyEtherEtherKetone) can vary depending on the specific production method and the desired properties of the final product. Typically, the average molecular weight of PEEK ranges from 30,000 to 60,000 g/mol. However, it can be as high as 100,000 g/mol or more in some cases. The molecular weight of PEEK is an important factor that affects its physical and chemical properties, such as its melting point, crystallinity, and solubility. Higher molecular weight PEEK tends to have better mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and impact resistance, but may have lower solubility in certain solvents. It's worth noting that the molecular weight of PEEK can be controlled by adjusting the conditions during polymerization, such as the type and amount of catalyst, reaction temperature, and reaction time.
